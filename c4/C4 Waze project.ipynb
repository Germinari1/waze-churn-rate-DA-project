    "You receive a new email from Sylvester Esperanza, your project manager. Sylvester tells your team about a new request from leadership: to analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type. You also discover follow-up emails from three other team members: May Santner, Chidi Ga, and Harriet Hadzic. These emails discuss the details of the analysis. They would like a statistical analysis of ride data based on device type. In particular, leadership wants to know if there is a statistically significant difference in mean amount of rides between iPhone® users and Android™ users. A final email from Chidi includes your specific assignment: to conduct a two-sample hypothesis test (t-test) to analyze the difference in the mean amount of rides between iPhone users and Android users"

This equal variance assumption might not hold in practice (that is, there is no strong reason to assume that the two groups have the same variance); you can relax this assumption by setting `equal_var` to `False`, and `stats.ttest_ind()` will perform the unequal variances $t$-test (known as Welch's `t`-test).
