# waze-churn-rate-DA-project
## Description
A Data Analysis/Science project that uses an (authorized) dataset from waze. In this project, user data is analyzed with the ultimate goal of creating a machine learning model that can predict user churn. During the stages of analysis, some concepts applied are: EDA and data cleaning, data visulization, statistics, hypothesis tets, ML models.

## Why should you care?
Preventing user churn is a special major concern for companies whose revenues depend directly on recurrent users. An analytical understanding of such phenomenon is key for promoting data-driven decisions that can (and do!) impact in financial results. This project analysis, in a series of systematic steps that employ data analysis and modeling, a study case in which user churn is investigated.
